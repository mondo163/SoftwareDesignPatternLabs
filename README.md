# Software Design Pattern Labs

# Description
This repository contains all of the labs I did during my Software Design Patterns class. The projects were
all given to us with a single starter code file that we built upon to demonstrate the design pattern implemented.
All starter code for the labs was given to us by our instructor Jeremy Ing and annotated in the correct files. 

# Design Patterns Implented:
- Strategy
- Factory
- Decorator
- MVVM
- Observer 
- Singleton
